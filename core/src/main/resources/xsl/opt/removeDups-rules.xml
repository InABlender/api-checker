   removeDups-rules.xml

   This basically contains rules for how various states may be merged
   together.  Essentially, we simply need to understand which
   attributes are optional and which are required. It should be
   possible to generate these rules from the XSD, but we'll leave
   that as an exercise :-)

   Before that, we need to make sure that all states are represented,
   perhaps via an assertion that checks the XSD.

   As part of the build process we generate an XSL template that's
   used by the removeDup optimization.
